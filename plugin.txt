Single-trial channel interpolation

This plugin offers a custom eegplot() function that allows channels to be manually marked for interpolation within single epochs. This 
tool helps to remove transient artifactual channel noise that might interfere with the unmixing of independent components, but avoids having
to reject entire epochs or having to interpolate entire channels.

This is similar functionality to the TBT plugin, but offers a manual and visual approach rather than purely automatic.
